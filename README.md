# Number-System-Converter

This Python program is used for converting between binary, decimal, 
hexadecimal, and octal number systems. It offers a menu-driven interface where 
users can select the type of conversion they want to perform and enter the 
value they want to convert. The program then displays the conversion results 
on the console and writes them to a file called cps109_a1_output.txt.

This program aims to support students enrolled in Computer Organization I (CPS213) at TMU or 
equivalent at a different institution by reinforcing understanding of binary 
concepts. It provides functionalities for converting between different number systems 
(binary, decimal, hexadecimal, octal) to solidify the understanding of number representations, 
arithmetic operations and data conversions are fundamental to the course and computer science
as a whole. By allowing students to input values in one number system and view the 
corresponding representations in others, this program serves as a practical tool 
for illustrating connections between binary arithmetic, data representation, and 
the broader concepts of computer science.
